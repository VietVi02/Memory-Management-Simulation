# Memory-Management-Simulation

A small React web app that simulates classic memory allocation algorithms — First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit — for operating system studies or demos.

You can either enter memory block and process sizes manually or let the app generate random ones for you. Then, run the simulation to see how each algorithm performs, including fragmentation and utilization.
